in this programme, we declare a variable ch of the type char to the character entered by the user
We use the "printf" function to prompt the user to enter a character 
And the "scanf" fumction to read the character from the keyboard.
The program then uses a series of "if" statements to check the ramge of ASCII values to determine the type of character.
If the character falls within the range of uppercase letters (ASCII values 65 to 90),it is considered a capital lette.
If the character falls within the range of lowercase letters (ASCII values 97 to 122), it is considered small case letters.
if the character falls within the range of digits (ASCII values 48 to 57), it is considered a digit.
Otherwise it is considered a special symbol
